To prototype, you'll need shadergarden. Follow the [blog post](https://blog.tonari.no/shadergarden) and [instructions here](https://github.com/tonarino/shadergarden) to get started, then run:

```bash
shadergarden run -w 500 -h 400
```

You should see whatever the current state of the project is. Mainly putting this up here to have a backup.
